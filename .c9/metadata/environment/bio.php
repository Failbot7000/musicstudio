The name Appassionato Music Studio was given in February of 2017 to better symbolize the core values of the studio. “Appassionato” is the Italian word for passionate. This word demonstrates the studio’s desire to create passion and emotion within the students’ music. The studio strives for the right balance between enjoyment of the art and maintaining a high level of playing from the students. Appassionato Music Studio constantly invites challenges and sets high yet reasonable goals for students to maximize the amount of progress, reward, and satisfaction that comes with the journey of learning music.</p> ","    ","    <p>Appassionato Music Studio currently contains over 20 students ranging from age 5 to 13.

Students have received top marks in the National Federation of Music Clubs (NFMC) Junior Festival. In addition, students hold a 100% pass rate in the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) exams.
